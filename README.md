# Development-Board-based-Charger-Power-Saving-Smart-Socket
Designing a Development Board-based Charger Power Saving Smart Socket device departs from problems that often occur but are often also ignored, namely forgetting to unplug the laptop charger when it is finished to use. This habit, whether we realize it or not, causes something called an Electric Vampire, where power is continuously wasted by loads that are still connected to electricity even though it is no longer used. One of them is a laptop charger that often forgets to unplug from the socket. The Development Board-based Charger Power Saving Smart Socket Device detects a difference in electric current when the charger is being used to charge the battery or not using current sensor ACS712. When the battery is full, there is a decrease in the current passing through the charger so that when the battery is full or the laptop charger is removed from the laptop, the relay (SSR) will cut off the power line so that the charger is no longer supplied and absorbs power for nothing.
