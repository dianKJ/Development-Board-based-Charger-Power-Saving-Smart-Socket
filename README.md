Project Title			:	Development Board-based Charger Power Saving Smart Socket

Position			:	Electronic Engineer and Programmer (Hardware)

Jobdesc	:	Design and wiring electronic system. Ensure that the electronic system work properly and troubleshooting when needed. Ensure that current sensor ACS712 read and produce accurate data by sampling (program) and comparing from multimeter measuring.

Project Type	:	Course Project

Microcontroller	:	Arduino Nano

Software (Electronics)	:	Manual Wiring 

Software (Programming)	:	Arduino IDE and Proteus (Simulator)
	
Description			 :	Designing a Development Board-based Charger Power Saving Smart Socket device departs from problems that often occur but are often also ignored, namely forgetting to unplug the laptop charger when it is finished to use. This habit, whether we realize it or not, causes something called an Electric Vampire, where power is continuously wasted by loads that are still connected to electricity even though it is no longer used. One of them is a laptop charger that often forgets to unplug from the socket. The Development Board-based Charger Power Saving Smart Socket Device detects a difference in electric current when the charger is being used to charge the battery or not using current sensor ACS712. When the battery is full, there is a decrease in the current passing through the charger so that when the battery is full or the laptop charger is removed from the laptop, the relay (SSR) will cut off the power line so that the charger is no longer supplied and absorbs power for nothing.

Performance	:	The Development Board-based Charger Power Saving Smart Socket able to detect drop current when the charger unplug from the laptop. After being detect by sensor, relay switch off the power line so the charger is unpowered. If want to reconnect then power just press reset button.
